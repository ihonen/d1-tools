# d1-tools

## Introduction

This project contains a bunch of tools I have created for the purpose of
modifying the 2001 video game
[*Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desperados:_Wanted_Dead_or_Alive).
For whatever reason this game has always been close to my heart, so I wanted to
contribute a little something to my fellow nostalgists.

## TL;DR

TODO.

## Project structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `cmake` - CMake helper scripts.
- `extern` - External libraries.
- `include` - Public headers. Look here if you want to use my code!
- `scripts` - Scripts to make working with the project easier. Look here if you want to build the project!
- `src` - Implementation source code. In theory you should not need to look here, unless you want to contribute to the project.
